function [crit,Xout] = calc_epx_helper(MF,calc_int,t,par,X0v,glo,Xctrl,locX,Feff,WRAP2)

% Usage:  [crit,Xout] = calc_epx_helper(MF,calc_int,t,par,X0v,glo,Xctrl,locX,Feff,WRAP2)
% 
% Small helper function to calculate results needed for effect window and
% EPx calculations. This works to output effects at the end of <t>,
% relative to the control, but also a criterion to use with <fzero> to find
% exact EPx values. This is code that used to be in sub-functions of the
% effect window and EPx functions.
% 
% Inputs:
% <MF>       the multiplication factor to use on the exposure profile
% <calc_int> integrate survival and repro into 1) RGR, or 2) survival-corrected repro (experimental!)
% <t>        the time vector for calculating the response of the traits
% <par>      the optimised parameter set
% <X0v>      vector with scenario and initial values for the state variables
% <glo>      structure with information that is generally global
% <Xctrl>    value for the control trait (as EPx is relative to control)
% <locX>     location of trait(s) of interest in Xout
% <Feff>     the fraction effect (x/100 in EPx)
% <WRAP2>    a wrapper containing various variables needed for the intrinsic rate
