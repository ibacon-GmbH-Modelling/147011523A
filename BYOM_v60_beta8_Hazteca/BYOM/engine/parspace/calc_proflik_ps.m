function [coll_prof,coll_ok,phat,mll,coll_prof_pruned,flag_short] = calc_proflik_ps(pmat,coll_all,bnds_tmp,f,SETTINGS_OPTIM)

% Usage: [coll_prof,coll_ok,phat,mll,coll_prof_pruned,flag_short] = calc_proflik_ps(pmat,coll_all,bnds_tmp,f,SETTINGS_OPTIM)
% 
% Use the collected sample from parameter space to zoom in on the profile
% likelihood for the single parameters. This is useful to extract
% single-parameter CIs, but also to extend the sample with profiled sets.
% The latter may be useful when sampling is poor in some part of parameter
% space. Furthermore, the profiling does a number of optimisations (one
% parameter fixed), which may spot a better value of the optimum.
%
% Strategy is to split up the parameter range for each parameter into 50
% slices of equal width. Within each slice, look for the best-fitting set.
% Use that set as starting point for an optimisation (with the target
% parameter fixed to the middle of the slice). Also do another optimisation
% from the optimised value in the previous slice. Sometimes, extending a
% profile works better than taking the best available sample in the slice.
% From these two optimisations, the best value is optimised again and
% stored. Next, the profiling starts from the other side and calulates the
% next version from the previous profile point. In some cases, extending a
% profile from the other direction can find a better profile.
%
% Additionally, the algorithm is looking for situations where there is a
% substantial difference between the profile and the sample. If that
% happens in a relevant range (where the fit is still acceptable), the
% points are collected and will be used for an additional round of sampling
% (apparently, sampling was not optimal in that case). Note that the entire
% profile will also be added to the total sample as they are relevant
% parameter sets (this happens in <calc_parspace> at the end, when making
% CIs).
% 
% Extra output is a pruned version of <coll_prof> that is more useful for
% plotting and saving.
% 
% Inputs
% <pmat>      parameter matrix
% <coll_all>  the entire sample (matrix)
% <bnds_tmp>  boundaries of parameter space (log-transformed were needed)
% <f>         handle for waiting bar
% <SETTINGS_OPTIM> = settings read from setup_settings by <calc_optim_ps>
% 
% Outputs
% <coll_prof>  profile likelihoods with all parameters for each point (cell array)
% <coll_ok>    matrix with all candidate parameter sets for resampling
% <phat>       if the profiling found a better overall optimum, this
%              collects it (vector with fitted parameters only)
% <mll>        this function also returns the MLL; usually, this is the top
%              value in <coll_all> (only different when a better optimum is
%              found)
% <coll_prof_pruned>  pruned profile information; cell array with 2-column
%                     matrix for each fitted parameter
% <flag_short>        flag that is 1 when relevant part of the profile of
%                     at least one parameter is too short (triggers
%                     reprofiling)

%% BLOCK 4. Prune <coll_prof> for later plotting and saving
% The cell array <coll_prof> contains an n-by-6 matrix for each parameter.
% It contains all of the complete parameter sets that make up the profile
% likelihoods. This is handy when we want to resample from a set on the
% profile, to see if hitting parameters bounds for one parameter affects
% the CI of another parameter, and to augment the sample with the profiled
% sets. However, for plotting and saving, we can use a reduced set: only
% the x and y values for the profile (x values are values of the parameter
% of interest, y values are the associated MLL). The first pruning step is
% thus to remove the information on the non-profiled parameters from the
% array.
% 
% The second step of pruning is to remove parts of the profile that we are
% not interested in. Everything beyond the chi2 cut-off for the 95% joint
% CI of the parameters can be removed. Normally, profiling won't go there.
% However, some part of the profile may become irrelevant after we found a
% better optimum, so that needs to be removed. This could leave the profile
% short (few points, which implies low resolution), which will flag
% re-profiling in <calc_parspace>.

flag_short = 0; % if nothing happens, flag is zero
coll_prof_pruned = cell(n_fit,1); % create empty cell array

for i_p = 1:n_fit % run through the fitted parameters
    
    coll_prof_tmp = [coll_prof{i_p}(:,i_p) coll_prof{i_p}(:,end)]; % create a temporary matrix with the x and y values of this profile
    % This is step 1: removing info on other parameters than the profiled one.
    
    ind_outofbnds = coll_prof_tmp(:,1) > bnds_tmp(i_p,2) | coll_prof_tmp(:,1) < bnds_tmp(i_p,1); % indices to parts of the profiles that cross the min-max bounds
    coll_prof_tmp(ind_outofbnds,:) = [];
    
    % In some cases, we have tails on the profiles that extend to very
    % high values of the MLL (because we found a better optimum
    % during/after profiling). These tails can be pruned in step 2.
    if n_fit > 1
        ind_lo = find(coll_prof_tmp(:,2)<mll+chicrit_joint,1,'first'); % index to first entry that is within the cut-off
        ind_hi = find(coll_prof_tmp(:,2)<mll+chicrit_joint,1,'last');  % index to last entry that is within the cut-off
    else
        % Note: an extra 0.5 is needed when we are fitting only 1
        % parameter; otherwise, the profile is cut short (as the joint
        % criterion is the same as the single criterion).
        ind_lo = find(coll_prof_tmp(:,2)<mll+chicrit_joint+0.5,1,'first'); % index to first entry that is within the cut-off
        ind_hi = find(coll_prof_tmp(:,2)<mll+chicrit_joint+0.5,1,'last');  % index to last entry that is within the cut-off
    end
    
    ind_lo = max(1,ind_lo-1); % take one extra set lower if there is one
    ind_hi = min(size(coll_prof_tmp,1),ind_hi+1); % take one extra set higher if there is one
    
    coll_prof_pruned{i_p} = coll_prof_tmp(ind_lo:ind_hi,:); % only keep the ones without any extreme tails
    % Note: this procedure only keeps the sets within the criterion, and
    % adds one lower and higher. This last step is needed for extremely
    % steep profiles.
    
    coll_prof_pruned{i_p}(isinf(coll_prof_pruned{i_p}(:,2)),2) = mll+100; % replace any INF with a very high value
    % Note: this implies that this part of the profile will be plotted as a
    % very steep line. Further, in <calc_parspace>, this will allow
    % interpolation rather than taking the extreme value. This improves the
    % CIs a little bit when a profile is extremely steep.
 
    % If, after pruning, the profile is rather short, flag that, so
    % <calc_parspace> will do an new round of profiling.
    if size(coll_prof_pruned{i_p},1) < 40 % 40 seems good enough
        flag_short = 1;
