function [data,w] = makerepro_ind(R,opt)

% Usage: [data,w] = makerepro_ind(R,opt)
%
% A small function to rework a reproduction data set with data for each
% individual separatley into a format to use in BYOM. For each individual,
% the number of neonates observed must be entered in <R> (not cumulated:
% just like observed in the test), with a -1 where the first eggs are
% observed in the brood pouch as well as for 'true zeros' later in life
% (moults without neonates). First column should be time (in days) and the
% first row should be the treatment identifiers. 
% 
% When a mother dies, the subsequent repro data should be given a NaN
% rather than a zero. There is room for discussion about what to do with
% any eggs or neonates that are observed at the same time at which the
% mother is found dead. I propose to count them as is, and use NaN for the
% next time points. 
% 
% Output depends on the settings in <opt>: 
% 0) Check whether we can use a single intermoult period for the entire
%    data set. Screen output will show mean intermoult times and brood 
%    sizes across the replicates, as function of brood number and treatment.
% 1) Cumulate reproduction, but remove the time points with zero
%    reproduction. Good for clutch-wise reproduction.
% 2) Cumulate reproduction, but don't remove zeros. Good for continuous
%    reproduction.
% 3) Shift neonate release back to the previous moult. When this option is
%    used, don't shift the model predictions with <glo.Tbp>: the data now
%    represent egg production rather than neonate release.
