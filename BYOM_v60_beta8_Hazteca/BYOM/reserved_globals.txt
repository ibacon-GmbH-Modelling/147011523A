List of reserved globals in structure "glo"
===========================================
The global structure "glo" can be used to pass on information between your script file and functions such as call_deri.m and derivatives.m. However, some fields on this structure should not be used by the user as they already have a definition within BYOM itself (though not in all packages). The following field names for the "glo" structure are used in BYOM, so avoid redefining them for your own purposes (list may not be totally up to date, sorry!):
