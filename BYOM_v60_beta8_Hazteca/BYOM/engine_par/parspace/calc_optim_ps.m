function [pmat,pmat_print,mll,names_out] = calc_optim_ps(pmat,opt_optim,WRAP)

% Usage: [pmat,pmat_print,mll,names_out] = calc_optim_ps(pmat,opt_optim,WRAP)
%
% Optimisation and finding a likelihood-based joint confidence region
% without the need for starting values. However, the parameter space to be
% searched must limited for the algorithm to be effective. Parameter space
% to be searched is defined as the min-max bounds of the parameters in the
% matrix <pmat>.
% 
% This function is a shell around the calibration algorithm in
% <calc_parspace>. It prepares for the optimisation, takes care of a
% restart (when slow kinetics is indicated during the optimisation), and it
% plots parameter space for saved sets if needed.
% 
% Note that the function <disp_pmat> is called to do the formatted printing
% (on screen) of <pmat> and <pmat_print>. The <pmat> is displayed before
% optimisation (to show the search ranges), the <pmat_print> after (with
% the optimised values and CIs).
%
% Inputs
% <pmat>        parameter matrix
% <opt_optim>   structure with options for optimisation
% <WRAP>        a wrapper for things that used to be global (e.g., glo and DATA)
% 
% Outputs
% <pmat>        same as input matrix, but with best parameters in first column
% <pmat_print>  matrix with parameter info (best fit, CIs, etc.)
% <mll>         minus log-likelihood for the fit
% <names_out>   when using a saved set, this will return the saved names
