%  Syntax: [MinColl,MinCI,ind_traits] = calc_effect_window(par_plot,fname_prof,Twin,opt_ecx,opt_conf)
%           PART OF ENGINE_PAR
% Calculate toxic effects due to an exposure profile, with moving time
% window and different (fixed) multiplication factors. This function should
% work with every TKTD model you throw at it, as long as there is at least
% one state variables indicated with one of the dedicated traits (whose
% position in the state vector is given by: <glo.locS>, <glo.locL> or
% <glo.locR>).
% 
% Some calculation speed can be gained by adding an option that skips
% recalculation of the control response when running through a sample for
% CIs, and when running through different start points for the time window
% (at least, when only tox parameters are fitted).
% 
% <par_plot>   parameter structure for the best-fit curve; if left empty the
%              structure from the saved sample is used
% <fname_prof> filename for the file containing the exposure profile
% <Twin>       length of time window (days)
% <opt_ecx>    options structure for ECx and EPx calculations
% <opt_conf>   options structure for making confidence intervals
% 
% <MinColl> collects, for each state, the MF, minimum of the trait relative
% to the control (thus largest effect), and time at which it occurs.
% <MinCI> collects the CI for the minimum trait level. Structure is
% MinColl{i_MF}(i_X,:). Output of ind_traits is needed to know which state
% is meant with i_X.
