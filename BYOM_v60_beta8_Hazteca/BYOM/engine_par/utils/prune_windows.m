function Trange_sel = prune_windows(Trange,Cw,Twin)

% Usage: Trange_sel = prune_windows(Trange,Cw,Twin)
% 
% Clever trick to reduce the number of windows to calculate from an
% exposure profile. This was worked out by Neil Sherborne: "First, for a
% given exposure profile list all possible time windows (day 0-21, 1-22
% etc.). Then find the largest minimum concentration across all time
% windows. Every window whose maximum is lower than the largest minimum
% cannot be the worst case, since there is a window where exposure is
% greater at all ages."
% 
% Note that Trange_sel is a vector with the same size as Trange, with 1's
% for the windows that are included, and zeros for the ones that are
% excluded. This works better than removing the elements from Trange, since
% now the removed windows are plotted as a 'gap' by calc_effect_window and
% calc_epx_window (rather than connecting them with a straight line).
% 
% This is not advised when there are feedbacks on the 'elimination rate'
% and the pMoA is assimilation, maintenance or growth. A paper on this
% topic is in preparation by Neil. Under these conditions, there may not be
% a unique EPx. Also when modifying the model equations, care is needed.
