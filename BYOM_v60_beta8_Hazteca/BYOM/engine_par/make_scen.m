function varargout = make_scen(type,varargin)

% Usage: varargout = make_scen(type,varargin)
%
% This function is used to prepare scenarios with time-varying exposure,
% and to apply it in <derivatives> or <simplefun>. <varargin> can contain
% one or more matrices with scenario definitions (Cw, see examples in the
% GUTS package).
%
% <type> is in various ways in the code below, so watch out. For
% constructing profiles in the global <glo>:
% 
% Type = 1 Creates a piecewise polynomial form of the forcing data points
% supplied. A plot is made to view the splines (cubic hermite spline is
% default). Cw matrices are allowed to contain more than one scenario.
%
% Type = 2 Creates a joint global from of the forcing events supplied
% (varargin contains one or more matrices for Cw). The exposure
% concentration is constant in the period between two events. Cw matrices
% are allowed to contain more than one scenario. This creates block pulses.
%
% Type = 3 Static renewal scenario. Creates a joint global from of the
% forcing events supplied (varargin contains one or more matrices for Cw).
% The exposure concentration decreases exponentially in the period between
% two renewal events. Cw matrices are allowed to contain more than one
% scenario.
%
% Type = 4 Linear interpolation in a time series, to be used with
% analytical solutions (e.g., for scaled damage in reduced GUTS models).
% 
% Negative values for <type> are used to signal specific activities from
% this this function, which are used internally in BYOM (e.g., to clear
% scenarios or to derive exposure concentrations from the globals).
% 
% Note that requesting exposure concentrations from a global scenario
% definition is now also done by <read_scen>. Advantage is that <glo> is no
% longer a global but an input, which makes it much faster when using ODE
% solvers. However, this function also keeps that functionality for now.
