%% BYOM function call_deri.m (calculates the model output)
%
%  Syntax: [Xout,TE,Xout2,zvd] = call_deri(t,par,X0v,glo)
%
% This function calls the ODE solver to solve the system of differential
% equations specified in <derivatives.html derivatives.m>. It is specific
% for the model in the directory 'ERA_special', and modified to deal
% with time-varying exposure by splitting up the ODE solving to avoid hard
% switches. 
% 
% As input, it gets:
% * _t_   the time vector
% * _par_ the parameter structure
% * _X0v_ a vector with initial states and one concentration (scenario number)
% * _glo_ the structure with various types of information (used to be global)
%
% The output _Xout_ provides a matrix with time in rows, and states in
% columns. This function calls <derivatives.html derivatives.m>. The
% optional output _TE_ is the time at which an event takes place (specified
% using the events function). The events function is set up to catch
% discontinuities. It should be specified according to the problem you are
% simulating. If you want to use parameters that are (or influence) initial
% states, they have to be included in this function. Optional output Xout2
% is for additional uni-variate data (not used here), and zvd is for
% zero-variate data (not used here).

%% Start

function [Xout,TE,Xout2,zvd] = call_deri(t,par,X0v,glo)

% These outputs need to be defined, even if they are not used
Xout2    = []; % additional uni-variate output, not used in this case
zvd      = []; % additional zero-variate output, not used in this case

%% Initial settings
% This part extracts optional settings for the ODE solver that can be set
% in the main script (defaults are set in prelim_checks). Further in this
% section, initial values can be determined by a parameter (overwrite parts
% of X0), and zero-variate data can be calculated. See the example BYOM
% files for more information.
% 
% This package will always use the ODE solver; therefore the general
% settings in the global glo for the calculation (useode and eventson) are
% removed here. This packacge also always uses the events function, so the
% option eventson is not used. Furthermore, simplefun.m is removed.

stiff      = glo.stiff; % ODE solver 0) ode45 (standard), 1) ode113 (moderately stiff), 2) ode15s (stiff)

if length(stiff) == 1 % second element is used for tolerances
    stiff(2) = 1; % by default: normally tightened tolerances
end

% Unpack the vector X0v, which is X0mat for one scenario
X0 = X0v(2:end); % these are the intitial states for a scenario
c  = X0v(1);     % the concentration (or scenario number)

% Start with a check on time-varying exposure scenarios. This is a
% time-saver! The isfield and ismember calls take some time that rapidly
% multiplies as derivatives is called many times.
glo.timevar = [0 0]; % flag for time-varying exposure (second element is to tell read_scen which interval we need)
if isfield(glo,'int_scen') && ismember(c,glo.int_scen) % is c in the scenario range of the global?
    glo.timevar = [1 0]; % tell derivatives that we have a time-varying treatment
end

% Deal with fitting multiple data sets with common parameters
if glo.timevar(1) == 1 % this requires scenarios to be used!
    if c >= 100 && ~isempty(names_sep) % then we have more data sets, and more separate parameters per set!
        i_d = floor(c/100); % extract the data set number from the treatment identifier
        for i_sep = 1:length(names_sep) % run through extra parameter names for separate sets
            par.(names_sep{i_sep}) = par.([names_sep{i_sep},num2str(i_d)]); % copy extra parameter level to par
        end
    end
end

% if needed, extract parameters from par that influence initial states in X0
% start from specified initial size in a model parameter
L0           = par.L0(1); % initial body length (mm) is a parameter
X0(glo.locL) = L0;        % put this estimate in the correct location of the initial vector

%% Calculations
% This part calls the ODE solver to calculate the output (the value of the
% state variables over time). There is generally no need to modify this
% part. The solver ode45 generally works well. For stiff problems, the
% solver might become very slow; you can try ode15s instead.

t     = t(:);   % force t to be a row vector (needed when useode=0)
t_rem = t;      % remember the original time vector (as we will add to it)

% The code below is meant for discontinous time-varying exposure. It will
% also work for constant exposure. Breaking up will not be as effective for
% piecewise polynomials (type 1), and slow, so better turn that off
% manually when you try splining. The code will run each interval between
% two exposure 'events' (in Tev) separately, stop the solver, and restart.
% This ensures that the discontinuities are no problem anymore.

TE  = 0; % dummy for time of events in the events function
Tev = [0 c]; % exposure profile events setting: without anything else, assume it is constant

InitialStep = max(t)/100; % specify initial stepsize
MaxStep     = max(t)/10;  % specify maximum stepsize
% For constant concentrations, and when breaking the time vector, we can
% use a default; Matlab uses as default the length of the time vector
% divided by 10.

if glo.timevar(1) == 1 % time-varying concentrations?
    % if it exists: use it to derive time vector for the events in the exposure scenario    
    Tev = read_scen(-2,c,-1,glo); % use read_scen to derive exposure concentration events
    % the -2 lets read_scen know we need events, the -1 that this is also needed for splines!
    
    min_t = max(min_t,length(Tev(Tev(:,1)<t(end),1))*2); 
    % For very long exposure profiles (e.g., FOCUS profiles), we now
    % automatically generate a larger time vector (twice the number of the
    % relevant points in the scenario). This is only used to set step size
    % when not using break_time, and for locating maximum length under
    % no-shrinking.
    
    if break_time == 0
        InitialStep = t(end)/(10*min_t); % initial step size
        MaxStep     = t(end)/min_t;      % maximum step size
        % For the ODE solver, when we have a time-varying exposure set
        % here, we base minimum step size on min_t. Small stepsize is a
        % good idea for pulsed exposures; otherwise, stepsize may become so
        % large that a concentration change is missed completely. When we
        % break the time vector, limiting step size is not needed.
    end
end

% This is a means to include a delay caused by the brood pounch in species
% like Daphnia. The repro data are for the appearance of neonates, but egg
% production occurs earlier. This global shifts the model output in this
% function below. This way, the time vector in the data does not need to be
% manipulated, and the model plots show the neonate production as expected.
bp = 0; % by default, no brood-pouch delay
if glo.Tbp > 0 % if there is a need for a brood-pouch delay ... (glo.Tbp must be defined!)
    tbp = t(t>glo.Tbp)-glo.Tbp; % extra times needed to calculate brood-pounch delay
    t   = unique([t;tbp]);      % add the shifted time points to account for brood-pouch delay
    bp  = 1;                    % signal rest of code that we need brood-pouch delay
end

% When an animal cannot shrink in length, we need a long time vector as we
% need to catch the maximum length over time.

% BROOD POUCH POINTS WERE HERE, BUT MOVED UP, BEFORE ADDING POINTS IN

% Breaking up the time vector is faster and more robust when calibrating on
% data from time-varying exposure that contain discontinuities. However,
% when running through very detailed exposure profiles (e.g., those from
% FOCUS), it is probably best to use break_time=0. Testing indicates that
% breaking up will be much slower than simply running the ODE solver across
% the entire profile (and produces very similar output).
% 
% Note: it is possible to initialise tout and Xout with NaNs, and avoid
% these matrices to grow. This may be a bit slower for exposure scenarios
% with few events, but faster for scenarios with many.

t = unique([T;t;(T(1:end-1)+T(2:end))/2]); % combine T, t, and halfway-T into new time vector
% this hopefully prevents the ODE solver from missing exposure pulses
% NOTE: this must be done for break_time=1 as well. The ODE solver
% will stop/start at those points, so the last entry in Xout is needed as
% starting value for the next round! However, we can also do this for
% break_time=0 only, and make sure that elements of T are in the temporary
% time vector for the ODE solver (as done in DEBtox2019).

%% Output mapping

%  vector is needed. We cannot use the events function to find the exact
%  point at which length becomes negative, since the events functions only
%  looks at states, and not at the derivatives!

    Xout(:,glo.locL) = maxL; % replace length is Xout with new maximised body length
end

Xout(:,glo.locS) = max(0,Xout(:,glo.locS)); % make sure survival does not get negative
% In some case, it may become just a bit negative, which means zero.
