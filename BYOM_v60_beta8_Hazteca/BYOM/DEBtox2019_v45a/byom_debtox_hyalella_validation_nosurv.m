%
% BYOM is a General framework for simulating model systems in terms of
% ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The model itself needs to be
% specified in <derivatives.html derivatives.m>, and <call_deri.html
% call_deri.m> may need to be modified to the particular problem as well.
% The files in the engine directory are needed for fitting and plotting.
% Results are shown on screen but also saved to a log file (results.out).
%
%  *The model:* simple DEBtox model for toxicants, based on DEBkiss and
% formulated in compound parameters. The model includes flexible modules
% for toxicokinetics/damage dynamics and toxic effects. The DEBkiss e-book
% (see <http://www.debtox.info/book_debkiss.html>) provides a partial
% description of the model; the publication of Jager in Ecological
% Modelling contains the full details:
% <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2019.108904>.
%
% *This script:* This script demonstrates the use of the parameter-space
% explorer from the openGUTS project (see <http://www.openguts.info/>) in
% making predictions for a validation data set, given a previous
% calibration in a MAT file. The controls of the validation data set will
% be fitted, but the tox parameters taken from the saved file.

%% Initial things
% Make sure that this script is in a directory somewhere *below* the BYOM
% folder.

clear, clear global % clear the workspace and globals
global DATA W X0mat % make the data set and initial states global variables
global glo          % allow for global parameters in structure glo
diary off           % turn off the diary function (if it is accidentaly on)
% set(0,'DefaultFigureWindowStyle','docked'); % collect all figure into one window with tab controls
set(0,'DefaultFigureWindowStyle','normal'); % separate figure windows

pathdefine(1) % set path to the BYOM/engine directory (option 1 uses parallel toolbox)
glo.basenm  = mfilename; % remember the filename for THIS file for the plots
glo.saveplt = 2; % save all plots as (1) Matlab figures, (2) JPEG file or (3) PDF (see all_options.txt)

%% The data set
% Data are entered in matrix form, time in rows, scenarios (exposure
% concentrations) in columns. First column are the exposure times, first
% row are the concentrations or scenario numbers. The number in the top
% left of the matrix indicates how to calculate the likelihood:
%
% * -1 for multinomial likelihood (for survival data)
% * 0  for log-transform the data, then normal likelihood
% * 0.5 for square-root transform the data, then normal likelihood
% * 1  for no transformation of the data, then normal likelihood

% NOTE: time MUST be entered in DAYS for the estimation of starting values
% to provide proper search ranges! Controls must use identifiers 0 for the
% true control and 0.1 for the solvent control. If you want to use another
% identifier for the solvent, change parameter id_solvent in
% automatic_runs.

TR   = 0.5; % transformations for continuous data
opt  = 2; % select an option (opt=1 is recommended for Daphnia)

% Options to deal with repro data set:
% 0) Check whether we can use a single intermoult period for the entire
%    data set. Screen output will show mean intermoult times and brood 
%    sizes across the replicates, as function of brood number and treatment.
% 1) Cumulate reproduction, but remove the time points with zero
%    reproduction. Good for clutch-wise reproduction.
% 2) Cumulate reproduction, but don't remove zeros. Good for continuous
%    reproduction or when animals are not followed individually.
% 3) Shift neonate release back to the previous moult. When this option is
%    used, don't shift the model predictions with <glo.Tbp>: the data now
%    represent egg production rather than neonate release.

% The data set is specified in a separate function. This is done so that we
% can easily combine or swap data sets in calibration and validation. Last
% entry is the number of the data set (if there is more than one, the
% scenario identifiers of the next one will have 100 added, the next one
% 200 added, etc.).

[data1,w1,LabelTable1] = data_AZT_Hazteca_validation2a_nosurv(TR,opt,1);
%[data1,w1,LabelTable1] = data_AZT_Hazteca_validation2a(TR,opt,1);

DATA = [data1]; % for more sets, use [data1;data2;...]
W    = [w1];    % for more sets, use [w1;w2;...]

if opt == 0 % check intermoult duration (and mean brood size)
    return % we need to stop to check the results (no data are created)
end 
% Note: glo.Tbp will be read from MAT file below.

% Create a table with nice custom labels for the legends
glo.LabelTable = [LabelTable1]; % for more sets, use [LabelTable1;LabelTable2;...]

%% Call the Matlab GUI open-file element to load profile and MAT file

conf_type = select_pred(1); 
% Note that this function sets glo.mat_nm (to allow reading a sample from a
% different filename than the one indicated by the name of THIS script). It
% sets glo.Tbp as well. It sets it to the value used for the model fitting
% that generated the MAT file, or zero otherwise. When using an older MAT
% file (pre BYOM v6), make sure to set glo.Tbp to the correct value if it
% needs to be >0.

%% Initial values for the state variables
% Initial states, scenarios in columns, states in rows. First row are the
% 'names' of all scenarios.

X0mat = [glo.LabelTable.Scenario]'; % the scenarios (here identifiers) 
X0mat(2,:) = 0; % initial values state 1 (scaled damage)
X0mat(3,:) = 0; % initial values state 2 (body length, initial value overwritten by L0)
X0mat(4,:) = 0; % initial values state 3 (cumulative reproduction)
X0mat(5,:) = 1; % initial values state 4 (survival probability)

% Put the position of the various states in globals, to make sure that the
% correct one is selected for extra things (e.g., for plotting in
% plot_tktd, in call_deri for accommodating 'no shrinking', for population
% growth rate).
glo.locD = 1; % location of scaled damage in the state variable list
glo.locL = 2; % location of body size in the state variable list
glo.locR = 3; % location of cumulative reproduction in the state variable list
glo.locS = 4; % location of survival probability in the state variable list

%% Initial values for the model parameters
% Model parameters are part of a 'structure' for easy reference. 
  
% global parameters as part of the structure glo
glo.FBV    = 0.02;    % dry weight egg as fraction of structural body weight (-) (for losses with repro; approx. for Daphnia magna)
glo.KRV    = 1;       % part. coeff. repro buffer and structure (kg/kg)
glo.kap    = 0.8;     % approximation for kappa
glo.yP     = 0.8*0.8; % product of yVA and yAV (assume they are both 0.8)
glo.Lm_ref = 9.15;       % reference max length for scaling rate constants
glo.len    = 2;       % switch to fit length 1) with shrinking, 2) without shrinking (used in call_deri.m)
% NOTE: the settings above are species specific! It is usually a good idea
% to use the same settings as used for calibration.
% 
% NOTE: for arthropods, one would generally want to fit the model without
% shrinking (since the animals won't shrink in length). 

% Note: all parameters need to be defined, even when using the optimised
% values and other settings from file. Two types of analysis make sense for
% validation: 
% 
% 1) Use all parameters from the saved set (both the fixed ones in the
% analysis and the fitted ones with their sample). To this end, plot_tktd
% needs to be called with an empty matrix [] as first input, or with
% <par_out> as defined through <automatic_runs>.
% 
% 2) Use the fitted parameters (and their sample) from the saved set, but
% use basic parameters (that were fixed in calibration!) from user input in
% <par>, below. To this end, plot_tktd needs to be called with <par> as
% first input, and the following option needs to be set:
% opt_conf.use_par_out = 1. This is useful when the control response is
% different in the validation experiment. 

% mean length at start taken as mean of the true controls at t=0, and fixed below
% mL0 = mean(DATA{1,2}(2,1+find(DATA{1,2}(1,2:end)==0)));

% - Note 1: it does not matter whether length measures are entered as actual
% length or as volumetric length (as long as the same measure is used
% consistently). 
% - Note 2: hb is fitted on log-scale. This is especially helpful for
% fit_tox(1)=-2 when hb is fitted along with the other parameters. The
% simplex fitting has trouble when one parameter is much smaller than
% others. 
% - Note 3: the min-max ranges in par are appropriate for Daphnia magna. For
% other species, these ranges and starting values need to be modified.

% after automatic_runs has made sure that par_out is defined.

%% Time vector and labels for plots

% specify the x-axis label (same for all states)
glo.xlab    = 'time (days)';
glo.leglab1 = 'scen. '; % legend label before the 'scenario' number
glo.leglab2 = ''; % legend label after the 'scenario' number
% Note: these legend labels will not be used when we make a glo.LabelTable

prelim_checks % script to perform some preliminary checks and set things up
% Note: prelim_checks also fills all the options (opt_...) with defauls, so
% modify options after this call, if needed.

%% Calculations and plotting
% Here, the function is called that will do the calculation and the plotting.
% Options for the plotting can be set using opt_plot (see prelim_checks.m).
% Options for the optimsation routine can be set using opt_optim. Options
% for the ODE solver are part of the global glo. 
% 
% NOTE: for this package, the options useode and eventson in glo will not
% be functional: the ODE solver is always used, and the events function as
% well.

% -------------------------------------------------------------------------
% Configurations for the ODE solver
glo.stiff = [0 3]; % ODE solver 0) ode45 (standard), 1) ode113 (moderately stiff), 2) ode15s (stiff)
% Second argument is for default sloppy (0), normally tight (1), tighter
% (2), or very tight (3) tolerances. Use 1 for quick analyses, but check
% with 3 to see if there is a difference! Especially for time-varying
% exposure, there can be large differences between the settings!
glo.break_time = 1; % break time vector up for ODE solver (1) or don't (0)
% Note: breaking the time vector is a good idea when the exposure scenario
% contains discontinuities. Don't use for continuous splines (type 1) as it
% will be much slower. For FOCUS scenarios (high time resolution), breaking
% up is not efficient and does not appear to be necessary.
% -------------------------------------------------------------------------

opt_plot.repls    = 0; % set to 1 to plot replicates, 0 to plot mean responses
basenm_rem        = glo.basenm; % remember basename as automatic_runs may modify it!

% Select what to fit with fit_tox (this is a 3-element vector). NOTE: use
% identifier c=0 for regular control, and c=0.1 for solvent control. When
% entering more than one data set, use 100 and 100.1 for the controls of
% the second data set (and 101, 102 ... for the treatments), 200 and 200.1
% for the controls of the third data set. etc. 
% 
% First element of fit_tox is which part of the data set to use:
%   fit_tox(1) = -2  comparison between control and solvent control (c=0 and c=0.1)
%   fit_tox(1) = -1  control survival (c=0) only
%   fit_tox(1) = 0   controls for growth/repro (c=0) only, but not for survival
%   fit_tox(1) = 1   all treatments, but, when fitting, keep all control parameters fixed; 
%               run through all elements in MOA and FEEDB sequentially and 
%               provide a table at the end (plots are made incl. control)
% 
% Second element of fit_tox is whether to fit or only to plot:
%   fit_tox(2) = 0   don't fit; for standard optimisations, plot results for
%               parameter values in [par], for parspace optimisations, use saved mat file.
%   fit_tox(2) = 1   fit parameters
% 
% Third element is what to use as control (fitted for fit_tox(1) = -1 or 0)
% (if this element is not present, only regular control will be used)
%   fit_tox(3) = 1   use regular control only (identifier 0)
%   fit_tox(3) = 2   use solvent control only (identifier 0.1)
%   fit_tox(3) = 3   use both regular and control (identifier 0 and 0.1)
% 
% The strategy in this script is to fit hb to the control data first. Next,
% fit the basic parameters to the control data. Finally, fit the toxicity
% parameter to the complete data set (keeping basic parameters fixed. The
% code below automatically keeps the parameters fixed that need to be
% fixed. 
% 
% MOA: Mode of action of toxicant as set of switches
% [assimilation/feeding, maintenance costs (somatic and maturity), growth costs, repro costs] 
% [1 0 0 0 0]   assimilation/feeding
% [0 1 0 0 0]   costs for maintenance 
% [0 0 1 1 0]   costs for growth and reproduction
% [0 0 0 1 0]   costs for reproduction
% [0 0 0 0 1]   hazard for reproduction

% [0 0 1 0]     damage that is diluted by growth
% [0 0 0 0]     damage that is not diluted by growth

% These are the MoA's and feedback configurations that will be run
