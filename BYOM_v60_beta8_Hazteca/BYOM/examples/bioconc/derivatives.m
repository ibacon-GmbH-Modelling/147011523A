%% BYOM function derivatives.m (the model in ODEs)
%
%  Syntax: dX = derivatives(t,X,par,c,glo)
%
% This function calculates the derivatives for the model system. It is
% linked to the script files <byom_bioconc_extra.html byom_bioconc_extra.m>
% and <byom_bioconc_start.html byom_bioconc_start.m>. As input,
% it gets:
%
% * _t_   is the time point, provided by the ODE solver
% * _X_   is a vector with the previous value of the states
% * _par_ is the parameter structure
% * _c_   is the external concentration (or scenario number)
% * _glo_ is the structure with information (normally global)
% 
% Note: _glo_ is now an input to this function rather than a global. This
% makes the code considerably faster.
%
% Time _t_ and scenario name _c_ are handed over as single numbers by
% <call_deri.html call_deri.m> (you do not have to use them in this
% function). Output _dX_ (as vector) provides the differentials for each
% state at _t_.

%% Start
% Note that, in this example, variable _c_ (the scenario identifier) is not
% used in this function. The treatments differ in their initial exposure
% concentration that is set in X0mat. Also, the time _t_ and structure _glo_ are not
% used here.

function dX = derivatives(t,X,par,c,glo)

%% Unpack states
% The state variables enter this function in the vector _X_. Here, we give
% them a more handy name.

Cw = X(1); % state 1 is the external concentration
Ci = X(2); % state 2 is the internal concentration

%% Unpack parameters
% The parameters enter this function in the structure _par_. The names in
% the structure are the same as those defined in the byom script file. The
% 1 between parentheses is needed for fitting the model, as each parameter
% has 4-5 associated values.

kd   = par.kd(1);   % degradation rate constant, d-1
ke   = par.ke(1);   % elimination rate constant, d-1
Piw  = par.Piw(1);  % bioconcentration factor, L/kg
Ct   = par.Ct(1);   % threshold external concentration that stops degradation, mg/L

% % Optionally, include the threshold concentration as a global (see script)
% Ct   = glo.Ct;      % threshold external concentration that stops degradation, mg/L

%% Calculate the derivatives
% This is the actual model, specified as a system of two ODEs:
%
% $$ \frac{d}{dt}C_w=-k_d C_w \quad \textrm{as long as } C_w>C_t $$
%
% $$ \frac{d}{dt}C_i=k_e(P_{iw}C_w-C_i) $$

if Cw > Ct          % if we are above the critical internal concentration ...
    dCw = -kd * Cw; % let the external concentration degrade
else                % otherwise ...
    dCw = 0;        % make the change in external concentration zero
end

dCi = ke * (Piw * Cw - Ci); % first order bioconcentration

dX = [dCw;dCi]; % collect both derivatives in one vector dX
